# 30-day Beta evidence register

Status: **active**.

The Beta clock began when [`v1.0.0-beta.1`](https://github.com/denggui-ai/threadtruth-studio/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1) was published at **2026-09-13T04:59:28Z** (Asia/Shanghai: **2026-09-13 12:59:28**). The 30-day minimum reaches **2026-10-13T04:59:28Z**; elapsed time alone does not satisfy the exit criteria.

Publication baseline: one maintainer-owned authorized complete workflow, one auxiliary CC0 rights case, one of 24 styles with final-image evidence, and zero qualifying non-maintainer installations. Beta.3 added the white-vest 24-style preview collection; beta.4 adds the coordinated-outfit 24-style preview collection. Neither adds a complete workflow.

## Maintainer preflight — 2026-09-12

The public repository and required CI are active. On the maintainer machine, `1.0.0-beta.1` completed install, discovery, uninstall, reinstall, cache-buster upgrade, legacy rollback, and final restoration. Explicit invocation, substantive implicit discovery, and non-apparel isolation passed. A minimal implicit missing-image request may skip Skill loading; this medium-severity limitation is tracked in [Issue #1](https://github.com/denggui-ai/threadtruth-studio/issues/1).

This preflight is not a non-maintainer installation, a real workflow case, or the start of the 30-day Beta clock.

Institution-sourced CC0 auxiliary cases are also excluded from the installation and complete-case thresholds. They demonstrate reproducible rights handling only; the maintainer-owned publication-authorized main case remains a separate prerequisite.

## Exit criteria

These are the project's own evidence targets, not fixed OpenAI admission requirements. Patch releases do not restart the clock. Admission remains an external decision.

- At least five non-maintainer installations.
- At least three complete, authorized real workflows.
- At least one patch release driven by external feedback.
- At least one clean-environment install, discovery, upgrade, uninstall, and rollback validation.
- No open high-severity issues.
- Stable `v1.0.0` published.

## Privacy-preserving records

Do not add runtime telemetry. For each opt-in tester, record a public handle or pseudonymous ID, environment class, version, install outcome, workflow outcome, linked Issue/Discussion if any, consent to publish the record, and date. Do not store email, customer content, raw private prompts, cookies, tokens, or full logs.

## Register

| ID | Non-maintainer | Host / version / OS | Plugin version | Install / discovery / recognition | Complete case | Feedback link | Publish consent | Date |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

No qualifying external tester record has been added yet.

## Opt-in feedback and local metrics

Use the [installation feedback form](https://github.com/denggui-ai/threadtruth-studio/issues/new?template=installation-feedback.yml). Issues and Discussions are public even without evidence consent; consent controls whether a sanitized record is counted in this register. Do not submit customer media, private prompts, email, tokens, or full logs. A nickname/public handle is sufficient. Count a consenting non-maintainer once, regardless of repeated reports or versions; record failed discovery/recognition separately instead of treating a download as a working installation.

Maintainers can run `python3 tools/beta-metrics.py` from the development checkout using an already authenticated GitHub CLI. This makes read-only GitHub requests and writes summary snapshots only to ignored `.threadtruth/beta-metrics/`. It never publishes or adds runtime telemetry. Optional `--install-register` accepts a local JSON list with `public_id`, `host`, `host_version`, `plugin_version`, `date`, boolean `non_maintainer` / `public_consent`, and `install` / `discovery` / `recognition` results (`pass`, `fail`, `not-tested`). Counts are deduplicated case-insensitively; raw identities are not copied into snapshots. Cross-handle duplicates require maintainer review.

Plugin ZIP, original media ZIP, checksum and other downloads are recorded separately. Traffic is a UTC rolling 14-day snapshot; overlapping weeks must never be added together. Unavailable/forbidden data is marked unavailable, not zero. Only reviewed aggregates may be added to this public register. Retain local summaries through the Beta review; inspect and explicitly delete selected dated snapshots when no longer needed.

Two preview targets are published: beta.3 retains the frozen white-vest 24-style collection, and beta.4 adds the coordinated-outfit 24-style collection. Each is 24/24 machine-layout checked, maintainer accepted and publicly included. They remain six-pose direction previews, never satisfy the three-complete-workflow target, and do not change the Beta clock. See the [total task register and schedule](WORK-STATUS.md).
