- [Single garment: 24 historical direction previews](style-previews/white-vest-24-v1/).
- [Coordinated outfit: 24 historical direction previews](style-previews/beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1/).
- [Single garment: six independent final images](primary-cases/white-hooded-puffer-vest-korean-cold/README.md).

Each direction preview is one six-panel sheet, not six independent finals. A complete public coordinated-outfit six-image case remains to be added. Existing previews establish their documented historical scope only. [Prepare your own photos](../INPUT-GUIDE.md) · [Choose an output](../CAPABILITIES.md).

Primary status: one `image-ready` public case. Auxiliary status: one `auxiliary-demo-ready` case.

Preview demonstrations are separate from primary-case evidence: **single garment · 24 styles** is the frozen published white-vest schema-v4 collection; **coordinated outfit · 24 styles** is the published, maintainer-accepted [beige-blazer schema-v5 collection](style-previews/beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1/) from beta.4. Neither collection is six independent finals, external adoption or another complete primary case.

ThreadTruth is installed in Codex. On supported Codex surfaces, use the skill picker or `$threadtruth-studio`; Codex CLI can inspect `/skills`. For ChatGPT, explicitly select the [ChatGPT web handoff](../CHATGPT-WEB-TUTORIAL.md): transfer the numbered references and prompts manually, or use host-provided browser tools after authorization. The project is not claiming an official marketplace listing.

The first primary case is the [white hooded puffer vest in Korean Cold Editorial B1](primary-cases/white-hooded-puffer-vest-korean-cold/README.md). It includes four authorized source photographs, six independent accepted results, file hashes, canvas evidence, a closed human QA review, and an AI-generated-media disclosure. Original PNG results are distributed separately as a checksummed GitHub Release asset; the repository carries optimized display JPEGs.

A complete demo must contain:

1. original real garment source image(s);
2. recognition card;
3. style recommendation, full 24-style choice surface, and selected route trace;
4. one labeled `preview-grid` or a separately recorded single-image direction test;
5. six independently generated images with distinct hashes and one canvas contract;
6. per-image and set-level QA conclusion;
7. user confirmation closing every `qa-user-review` item;
8. completed rights record in `RIGHTS.md`, including the AI-generated-media label where applicable.

The [24-style evidence index](STYLES.md) links all 24 accepted white-vest direction previews published in beta.3. Every entry has one optimized native sheet, one labeled fixed-card derivative and one thumbnail. Six maintainer-requested corrections retain explicit replacement lineage. These historical previews do not change the separate 1/24 independent-final coverage or 1/3 complete-primary-case count. The newer [24-style paired gallery](https://denggui-ai.github.io/threadtruth-studio/) separately presents 48 comparison results with their own source records, rights disclosures, and reviews; it does not add complete six-image primary cases.

The optional The Met pipeline can create reproducible CC0 auxiliary cases, but it cannot replace a primary case or count toward Beta adoption. Candidate files stay in ignored local quarantine and need a complete human review before promotion. See [MEDIA-POLICY.md](MEDIA-POLICY.md).

## Single-style preview operator workflow (frozen schema 4.0; mutable schema 5.0)

The published white-vest schema-v4 collection is frozen byte-for-byte and every mutation command rejects it. New development runs use schema v5 with an explicit controlled source case and immutable authorization batches. The collector preserves native content and creates disclosed fixed-card presentation; it never calls image generation or fills human approval. The runtime Skill's action0 and six-independent-final behavior remain unchanged.

Exact `3:4` describes the display **card frame**, not the source photograph. Display boards are `1200×1200`, with six `360×480` cards at x=44/420/796 and y=140/636. Complete pose images fit inside each card using uniform downscaling and padding; no stretch, upscale, generative fill or crop of the model/garment. Only original gutters and text regions are excluded when extracting the observed six panels. If a native pose is already cropped or distorted, layout cannot repair it.

The registered complete bilingual style name and mode subtitle are rendered in separate header bands. The footer is:

```text
AI生成 · 排版衍生预览 · 非成片 / PREVIEW ONLY — NOT FINAL
```

Use a readable local Chinese font with `--font`. Its basename/hash is evidence; the font binary and absolute local path are not public assets. Missing fonts or text that cannot fit cause failure, not silent truncation.

### Prepare, ingest and compose

Start a new run. Schema1–3 runs remain read-only with their original findings and cannot be upgraded in place or inherit current approval. The unchanged native prompt binding allows reuse of a registered schema3 original and its real call record in a fresh run; it does not create a new generation call.

```bash
python3 tools/style-preview.py prepare --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --source-case beige-blazer-denim-outfit
python3 tools/style-preview.py register-batch --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --manifest /path/to/authorized-batch.json
python3 tools/style-preview.py ingest --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --style korean-cold-editorial --image /path/to/original.png --generation-record /path/to/actual-generation.json
python3 tools/style-preview.py compose --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --style korean-cold-editorial --layout-json /path/to/observed-layout.json --font /path/to/local-cjk-font.ttc
python3 tools/style-preview.py audit --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --style korean-cold-editorial
python3 tools/style-preview.py gallery --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --style korean-cold-editorial
```

If a maintainer-authorized correction replaces a rejected native sheet, pass a sanitized `--correction-record` during ingest. It must bind the actual correction prompt and authorization/acceptance hashes plus the replaced call, original, optimized-native and display hashes. A correction cannot silently reuse the replaced call or output.

The generation record contains the real authorized call ID, observed generation time and exact executed prompt hash. Normal ingest must match the prepared prompt; a targeted correction preserves that plan hash while separately binding its actual correction prompt and replaced asset. Never rewrite an old prompt hash to match a new call.

`layout-json` has `original_sha256` and `cells`: exactly six row-major `[x,y,width,height]` rectangles observed in the retained native image. Bind the actual original hash; do not infer boundaries from the square board. Rectangles must be integer, positive, in bounds, non-overlapping and in the six-pose order. Different native panel ratios are allowed. Framing remains full-body for poses1/2/4/6, half-body permitted for3/5.

Compose keeps the native whole-sheet JPEG and creates a display JPEG plus whole-display thumbnail. Evidence records source authorization, native original and optimized hashes, actual call/prompt/pack/rule bindings, extraction rectangles, fit transforms, fixed-card geometry, font identity and derivative hashes. Identical repeated composition is idempotent; changed content is not a silent overwrite.

### Human review and publication

Machine layout checks prove fixed cards and artifact integrity only. They cannot prove visual fidelity, correctly observed boundaries, readable Chinese glyphs or human consent.

The review template remains pending. A real reviewer must compare the source and display: six complete poses, same garment/model, style, full-body framing where required, no content loss through extraction, padding, correct bilingual labels and AI disclosure. Review binds current source/display/evidence hashes. Missing, null, pending or failed checks are not approval.

```bash
python3 tools/style-preview.py approve --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1 --style korean-cold-editorial --review /path/to/completed-human-review.json
```

For a future collection, obtain each style's explicit generation instruction and repeat ingest/compose/review. No automatic retry or batch authorization is implied. Only after all24real reviews:

```bash
python3 tools/style-preview.py audit --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1
python3 tools/style-preview.py gallery --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1
python3 tools/style-preview.py promote --run-id beige-blazer-denim-outfit-24-v1
```

Schema-v5 public promotion includes only registered native whole-sheet JPEGs, layout derivatives, thumbnails and generated collection evidence/pages. It updates the collection and rights index transactionally without replacing white-vest representative links, style pages or README thumbnail slots. Raw originals, local receipts, batch files, font files and review drafts remain private. A failed/unapproved preview cannot enter public artifacts; no preview counts as an independent final, complete workflow or `image-ready` set.

## The Met auxiliary-media operator workflow

```bash
python3 tools/demo-media.py search --query coat --limit 8
python3 tools/demo-media.py fetch --run <run-id>
python3 tools/demo-media.py audit --run <run-id>
python3 tools/demo-media.py gallery --run <run-id>
```

For this separate The Met pipeline, approval and promotion are intentionally separate commands; its exact commands and checklist are printed in its offline gallery. Every new primary case and every additional style image still requires publication-authorized source media and a separate, explicit native-generation instruction.
